# Text_animation

In this script you will find text animation on videos which divide videos into frames although in this you can also add features like - External Audio , font style , font size , font colour and many more.


To add your text on video , you can find one file with .txt in which you can put what ever you want to add as a text and then just run the code.

To make it run you just have to run run.sh file which works for main code file and this run.sh file is argument based file so for your own videos , audio and text you have to add at own.


Do what ever you want to do !!!!!


Cheers !!!!
